ng # Debugging

If you clone down this lab and run the tests, you'll notice something:
everything's broken. Like, broken bad. And guess what?  It's on you to fix it!

Keep in mind, this lab is about more than just finding and fixing the errors -
it's about understanding how to look for what those errors are.  Don't just
guess and test.

And don't forget to use your best friend `binding.pry` to jump into your code
and confirm your suspicions. Remember to `require 'pry'` at top of each file you want to pry into.
